As a big fan of podcasts, I support a few through monthly donations/subscriptions via Patreon.  This gets me at least one additonal episode per week, which I love!  However, I find myself constantly going between platforms to listen to both the free and the premium content, so I decided to make an application that aggregates RSS feeds and presents the results in a React based front end.

START APPLICATION:
- npm install
- npm run react-dev
- npm start

NOTE:
- Since I have auth information attached to my Patreon account, downloading this repo won't actually show you any information on the UI, but you can see how the code works.  Eventually I want to allow other users to 

Eventual plans:
- create a login system to allow other users to use the application
- put information into database so there doesn't need to be fetches from other APIs
- cache popular choices
- Deploy to AWS
